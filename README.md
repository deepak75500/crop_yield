Crop Yield Prediction

A machine learning project focused on predicting crop yields using environmental and agricultural data. This repository contains datasets, modeling code, and evaluation results to help understand how different features (such as rainfall, soil type, and temperature) affect crop yield outcomes.

This project is ideal for learners and researchers interested in agricultural data science, environmental modeling, and machine learning applications in real‑world scenarios.

🧠 Project Overview

Crop yield prediction helps farmers, policymakers, and agri‑tech platforms make data‑driven decisions about:

Crop planning

Resource allocation

Risk prediction based on weather and soil data

Increasing agricultural productivity
